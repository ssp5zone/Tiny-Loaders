# Tiny AMD Loaders Usage

This is a demo of various Tiny AMD Module Loaders.

## Requirements

1. Node.js

## Run

1. Just clone or download.
2. Open cmd prompt or terminal here.
3. Run the following,
  ```bash
npm start
  ```

Sit back and relax. This will install the dependencies, build the files, start a small local server and even open the browser for you.

## Build

The project also demonstrates bundling of resorces using various module bundler.

As of now only one is works as expected.

Use the following command to build the files. _(npm start does it automatically)_
  ```bash
npm run build
  ```
